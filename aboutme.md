**Work:** In the past, I have worked as a web developer with Oracle's technologies.  At the moment, I am part of a R3D's development studio as a developer and it reeks of fresh air.  It brings a lot of new challenges in my career.

**Education:** I finished my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2013.  I've then pursued some higher courses around articial intelligence and data compression.  I'm interested in discussing and learning most subjects that speak technologies to me.

**Hobbies:** Video games, Animes, Powerlifting, Board games.
