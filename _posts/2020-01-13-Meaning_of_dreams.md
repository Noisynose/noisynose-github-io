Last weekend, I had a weird dream:  What seemed to be a happy hiking trip turned out to be a suicidal mission in a random toys mall with a serial killer.  Don't question me in why my brain thought of that scenario; sometimes, it wanders out of the reality plane!

Everything started off as a collegue of mine (Albert), another presence I can't describe and I hiking down a mountain when a sudden snowstorm appeared.  So far, it feels plausible as I attribute this as my bed is near my window: A potential windy snowstorm could be knocking at it.  As we were walking down the hill, a mirage-like cabin, with greeny hills, showed up.  Kinda unexpected.  Please note that Albert was as sick as a dog right there, right now:  4-5 pukes in row, to finally speaks about how his head has now "stabilized".  Reality:  I have a smoker couples next to my appartment, which often coughs and spits in their sink.  That would be my guess at the moment.  I don't recall a dream, besides this one, where at least one presence was sick in my party.

As for me, exhausted, decides I should take place in comfortable bed, conveniently place, besides the trees.  Talk about dreamception.  To be honest, this is a recurring pattern when I have avid dreams;  I can sleep/wake up multiple times in a night.  I still don't know what causes my brain to trigger that pattern.  Taking notes from now on will help my decipher this pattern.

Finally, I wake up in a strange suit, in the middle of a toys mall, with a friendly presence sharing with me the sight of a weird spinning object, growing and growing and growing... until it chopped my arms off my body.  I fell to the side, in hurt, noticing something strange: no blood is coming out my elbows.  That's the moment I triggered myself out of that sequence, just to relive the same exact kill scene, with different outcomes.  This reminds me of sands of time in Prince of Persia.
- Have you ever had hurting feel during your dreams ?  How was it like ?  Did it feel good, bad ?  Did you feel nothing ?
- If I rationalize this, the blood flow probably got cut off during a lapse of time, provoking my body to move from the position it was in. (Probably an awkward one)

I find dreams to be goofies, most of the time.  I want you to remember, what was your strangest dream ?  What was it about ?  What did it make you feel ?
