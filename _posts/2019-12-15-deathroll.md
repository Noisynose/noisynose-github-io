Recently, I've been consuming a lot of World of Warcraft Classic content from youtube.  One thing I love about this specific community is their appreciation for comedy videos.  I recommend you watch [UberDanger's AZEROTH ON FIRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrJap2Kx-qs);  I love how the creator approaches the gambling section of his video.

The gambling game is known as "Death roll".

Rules are simple:
- you broadcast if anybody wants to death roll for some currency;
- someone offers you a certain amount; (Ex: 20g)
- then, the bidder rolls the amount x 10; (In our case, 1 to 200, rolls a 42)
- as long as nobody rolls 1, your opponent rolls with an upper bound from the last result; (1 to 42, which is the last roll)
- the loser pays the bid amount to the winner;

I find this game interesting from a statistical standpoint (honest game, no tells, no lies), as it boils down to a mere 50-50 (coin toss) in majority of each duel.  I'm pretty sure this game would be Yumeko's favorite!  For this exact matter, I plan to use this game as a coding-kata for testing new technologies form now on.
